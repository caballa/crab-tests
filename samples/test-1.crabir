# this is a comment
# newline is used to delimit a new instruction, new block or new cfg
# A cfg must have a name
# Blocks are denoted as a string name followed by ":".
# The entry block of a cfg must be called "start"
# Left-hand side of assignments must be typed
# Constraints that appear in conditionals, assume, and assert must be also typed
